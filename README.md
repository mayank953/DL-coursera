<p>This Repository contains the solution of all programming exercises which one will encounter while doing the Coursera - Machine learning Specialization on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Coursera.</a></p>
<p>I suggest one to first try the programming&nbsp;assignment themselves before referring to the solution.</p>
